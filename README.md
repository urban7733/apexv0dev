## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is simple:
👉 **To become the world’s most accurate deepfake detection system.**
We empower creators and communities by:

* Exposing manipulated or AI-generated content.
* Protecting originality with transparent watermarking.
* Providing trustworthy analysis for media authenticity.

## 💡 Concept

Apex Verify AI is built to analyze **uploaded images or videos** and return:

* ✅ **Authenticity Score** (e.g., *95% Real*)
* 🔍 **Deepfake Detection** using state-of-the-art AI (PyTorch + Meta DINOv3 backbone + classifier)
* 🌐 **Image Reverse Search** across Instagram, Pinterest, X, and the broader web (Google Vision API)
* 🧠 **Spatial Understanding & Breakdown** of scene elements
* 📝 **AI Summary** in a clean, structured format

Example output:

```
Apex Verify AI Analysis: COMPLETE
- Authenticity Score: 99.9% – GENUINE MEDIA
- Assessment: Confirmed. No anomalies detected; media is authentic.
- Scene in Focus: Bugatti Chiron Hermès Edition & Veyron Rembrandt Edition in private showroom.
- Story Behind the Picture: Owned by Manny Khoshbin, verified source.
- Digital Footprint & Evidence: Links to Instagram + dealership posts.
- AI Summary: Genuine photo of rare Bugattis verified through reverse search + forensic analysis.

## 🏗 Architecture

Apex Verify AI combines **cloud-native AI pipelines** with a modern frontend:

### **Backend (Python / FastAPI)**

* Deepfake Detection DINOv3 + yolo11 + pytorch + gemini api
* Reverse Search → Google Vision API + custom crawler layer
* AI Summaries → Gemini API (Google GenAI)
* Media Watermarking → Transparent Apex Verify™ seal

### **Frontend (React + Tailwind)**

* Clean UI for uploading & reviewing results
* Structured analysis output with download option
* Stripe integration for creator payments / API access

### **Infrastructure**

* Google Vertex AI → model training & deployment
* Hugging Face integration for rapid model iteration
* Containerized deployment (Docker + GCP Cloud Run)
